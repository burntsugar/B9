===========

Java Robotics library for the Raspberry Pi.

B9 is a Java library to provide robotics devices support and uses the excellent [Pi4J](https://github.com/Pi4J) library.

Stuff that's in there now..

* GPS parsing via the Pi's onboard serial
* Spacial maths. Decimal degrees, headings - position, target and angle calculations.
* Binary motor control (forward and reverse 'tank tracks')
* Abstract Time (system time, GPS time, simulated time for running test cases)
* Wii Classic Controller (I2C)

Stuff that's in there but is still in progress..

* Compass Module
* Blue Robotics T100 BlueESC marine thrusters
